# Codeforces Solutions in C++20

An ongoing quest to solve all Codeforces problems [ordered by popularity](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC&locale=en) and learn some modern C++ in the process.

All solutions are original and released into the Public Domain. Please see LICENSE for details.

Some caveats.
* The C++ version might be upgraded in the future following adoption by Codeforces.
* Some problems might be solved out of order as I (try to) compete in ongoing contests.
* Some problems are not actually solved: they do not pass all Codeforces tests. Such problems can be identified by a file named `.unsolved` in the problem directory.
